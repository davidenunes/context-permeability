Context Permeability Model
==========================

# Build the model #
To create an executable model that can generate data based on a configuration
you need to use [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) and execute `maven build`. The 
[POM](https://maven.apache.org/pom.html) (_Project Object Model_) file included uses maven plugins to 
generate a jar with all the dependencies included. 

You can build this using the terminal or an IDE like eclipse or netbeans. They both allow for importing 
maven projects. The NetBeans 8.0 supports maven natively. Eclipse needs an aditional [plugin](https://maven.apache.org/eclipse-plugin.html).
